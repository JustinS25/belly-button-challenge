- ASK BCS provided outline of code involving the init(), buildCharts(), and optionChanged() functions. Provided code/explanations to help with each portion of selecting from the dropdown menu, updating/refreshing the data on the page when a new ID is picked, creating a resulting array to hold information for each id, etc. Prior to the help, most of my code ran partially and did not update the page as expected

- ASK BCS helped find why we need an optionChanged() function. It is shown in the index.html file and runs when a new choice is picked from dropdown menu

- ASK BCS helped with for loop in demographics() function. Was having trouble displaying text for all results and was only able to output 1 at a time. Also provided .append("h6") code to make the demographic info more readable in the text box

- Used [plotly.com](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for trace info on creating horizontal bar and bubble plots
